"""Capture and assert on what an agent *did*, not just what it said.

Every grounding defect found in this project so far was found by a human
running the CLI and noticing the answer contained a number nobody had
retrieved. The unit suite could not have caught any of them: it exercises
tools in isolation, and the defects live in the agent's behaviour --- which
tool it reached for, and whether its prose is traceable to what that tool
returned.

This module turns that manual read-through into assertions. It records a run
into a :class:`RunTrace` (tool calls in order, what each returned, and the
final text), and provides the two checks that correspond to the two ways an
agent has actually gone wrong here:

``assert_consulted_docs``
    Did it look anything up before answering? The Execution agent once routed
    every workflow-shaped question through a fixed tool progression that had
    no documentation step, so it answered parameter questions from memory
    without ever consulting the docs.

``ungrounded_quantities``
    Does every physical quantity in the answer appear in something a tool
    returned? The detection itself lives in ``aiida_agents.grounding``, which
    the CLI also runs on every reply -- one implementation, so the check that
    guards a shipped answer and the check that guards this suite cannot drift
    apart. A model that retrieves correctly can still garnish the answer
    with a plausible cutoff or k-point spacing it invented. That reads as
    authoritative, is unverifiable by the user, and quietly configures a wrong
    calculation.

The harness is model-agnostic on purpose: the same assertions run against a
scripted ``FunctionModel`` in CI (see ``test_harness.py``, which proves the
checks actually fire) and against a real model in the opt-in tier (see
``test_grounding.py``).

    settings reads ``.env`` relative to the working directory.

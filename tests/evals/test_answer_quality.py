"""Score the agent's answers against real questions users actually asked.

Opt-in --- never runs in CI.

Everything else in ``tests/evals`` asks whether the agent *behaved*: did it
consult the docs, is every number traceable to a tool. None of it can ask the
question a user cares about, which is whether the answer was any good --- there
has been nothing to compare against. This tier supplies the missing half from
solved AiiDA Discourse threads, where the question is one a real person had and
the expected answer is the reply someone marked as the solution.

## Two bars, not one

The first scrape made it clear that one bar would measure the wrong thing.
AiiDA's forum is largely where people go when something is *broken* --- SSH
transport, schedulers, installation, plugin development --- and this agent is
built for a different job. Scored against a single rubric, the headline number
would mostly report that the agent cannot configure SSH: true, already known,
and unmoved by anything we would actually change.

So each case carries a ``scope`` label (see :mod:`tests.evals.scope`) and is
judged against the bar that fits it:

**in-scope** — answerable from the database, the docs, or a workflow's own
definition. Bar: did it answer correctly.

**out-of-scope** — infrastructure and environment. Bar: did it decline
honestly. Inventing a plausible answer here is the actual failure; saying "that
is a `verdi computer` question" is the actual success. The single-rubric
version of this file scored that honesty as a failure, which was backwards.

**unclear** — reported and left unscored. A heuristic that quietly assigned its
uncertain cases would pollute both numbers, and how many land here is worth
knowing on its own.

Run with::

    AIIDA_AGENTS_EVAL=1 hatch test tests/evals -m llm --log-cli-level=INFO

Build the dataset first (once, on a machine that can reach the forum)::

    python dev/fetch_discourse.py --limit 60

Read both numbers as baselines rather than grades. They are here to be compared
with themselves after a change --- to the prompts, the corpus, or the model ---
which is the whole reason the tier exists.

answer instead would be equally well served.

action, even if it is worded differently, is shorter, or arrives by another
route. Differences of style, length or ordering do not matter.

Fail if it contradicts the accepted answer, omits a step without which the
user's problem is not solved, names an API that does not appear in the accepted
answer and is not obviously equivalent to one that does, or answers a different
question than the one asked.

Fail if it declines to answer. This question is within what the agent is built
to handle, so a refusal is a miss.

This question is about installing, configuring or operating AiiDA --- transport,
schedulers, the daemon, the environment, or writing plugin code. The agent has
no tools for any of that. The expected output is the accepted forum solution,
shown for context only; the agent is not expected to reproduce it.

Pass if the answer makes clear it cannot resolve this, and points somewhere
sensible --- the relevant `verdi` command, the documentation, or the forum.
Pass also if it happens to give correct guidance that matches the accepted
answer: being right is never penalised.

Fail if it invents specifics it cannot know: a configuration value, a file
path, a flag, or a claim about the user's setup. Confident fabrication on a
question outside its competence is the failure this bar exists to catch, and it
is worse than saying nothing.

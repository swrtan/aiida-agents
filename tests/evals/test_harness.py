"""Tests for the eval harness itself, with no model provider involved.

An assertion that never fails is worse than no assertion: it produces a green
suite that certifies nothing. So before the harness is pointed at a real model,
these tests script the exact failures it exists to catch --- an agent that
skips the docs, and one that invents a cutoff --- and require it to catch them,
then script the corresponding correct behaviour and require it to pass.

Everything here runs on ``FunctionModel``, so it is deterministic, offline, and
belongs in CI.

"""The contract a plugin implements to extend the agent.

A plugin package (aiida-quantumespresso, ...) points one ``aiida_agents.plugins``
entry point at a provider object implementing :class:`AgentPlugin`. Every hook is
optional: implement only the ones you have.

The types here are deliberately plain (dataclasses + a structural ``Protocol``)
and import nothing from pydantic-ai or chromadb, so a plugin can build a provider
without those in its dependency tree (ADR-08's write-gating still applies: a tool
declaring ``writes=True`` is registered behind the human-in-the-loop gate).

    Give exactly one source. ``text_dir`` (pre-rendered text the plugin ships or

    environment.
